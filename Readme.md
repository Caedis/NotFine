# NotFine

Extra video settings for Minecraft 1.7.10 implemented with Mixins

# Future Plans

Achieving and exceeding feature parity with Optifine, but not shaders.

Adding support for new leaf rendering modes to modded leaves.

Shaders will be supported when paired with [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) or [Shader Mod](https://github.com/basdxz/ShadersMod/) if all goes well.

# Requirements

One and only one of the following:

[UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins) (highly suggested)

[GTNH Mixins](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTNHMixins) with [Mixingasm](https://github.com/makamys/Mixingasm)

[GasStation](https://github.com/FalsePattern/GasStation) with [UniMixins'](https://github.com/makamys/Mixingasm) unimixins-gtnhmixins module.

# Know Conflicts:

Optifine. No, I will not be making them work together, please do not ask.

[Leaf Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/leafculling) A good mod, just not compatible due to feature overlap.
