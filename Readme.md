# NotFine

Extra video settings for Minecraft 1.7.10 implemented with Mixins.

# Future Plans

- Adding several same or similar features as compared to Optifine.
- More mod support for new leaf rendering modes.
- Shader support when paired with [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) and/or [Shader Mod](https://github.com/basdxz/ShadersMod/).

# Requirements

- [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins)

# Know Issues

- Always Translucent and Default(vanilla) cloud translucency will cause clouds to render over liquids.

# Know Conflicts

- [Leaf Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/leafculling) | Incompatible due to overlap. Suggested if you just want "Smart" leaf rendering.
- Optifine | Cannot be made compatible.

# New Leaf Rendering Mode Mod Compatibility

- Thaumcraft
- Twilight Forest
- Witchery
