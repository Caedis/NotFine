# NotFine

Extra video settings for Minecraft 1.7.10 implemented with Mixins

# Future Plans

Achieving and exceeding feature parity with Optifine, but not shaders.

Shaders will be supported when paired with [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) if all goes well.

# Know Conflicts:

Optifine. No, I will not be making them work together, please do not ask.
