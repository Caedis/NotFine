# NotFine

Extra video settings for Minecraft 1.7.10 implemented with Mixins.

# Future Plans

Achieving or exceeding feature parity with Optifine, bar shaders.

Adding support for new leaf rendering modes to modded leaves.

Shaders support when paired with [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) or [Shader Mod](https://github.com/basdxz/ShadersMod/).

# Requirements

One and only one of the following:

[UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins) (highly suggested)

[GTNH Mixins](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTNHMixins) with [Mixingasm](https://github.com/makamys/Mixingasm)

[GasStation](https://github.com/FalsePattern/GasStation) with [UniMixins'](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins) unimixins-gtnhmixins module.

# Know Issues:

Always translucent and default (vanilla) cloud translucency can cause clouds to render on top of liqueds.

# Know Conflicts:

Optifine - No, I will not be making them work together, please do not ask.

[Leaf Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/leafculling) - A good mod, just not compatible due to feature overlap.

# Mods With New Leaf Rendering Mode Support:

Thaumcraft
