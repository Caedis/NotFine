# NotFine

Extra video settings and performance improvements for Minecraft 1.7.10, implemented with Mixins.

# Future Plans

- Adding several similar features as compared to Optifine.
- More mod support for new leaf rendering modes.
- Shader support if used as part of [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) (WIP).

# Requirements

- [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins)

# Know Issues

- Always Translucent and Default(vanilla) cloud translucency will cause clouds to render over liquids.

# Know Conflicts

- [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) | Incompatible because Angelica includes NotFine.
- [Leaf Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/leafculling) | Incompatible due to overlap. Suggested if you just want "Smart" leaf rendering.
- Optifine | Cannot be made compatible.

# New Leaf Rendering Mode Mod Compatibility

## Mods that properly implement leaf blocks and do not need patched

- [Et Futurum Requium](https://modrinth.com/mod/etfuturum)

- [Twilight Forest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-twilight-forest) 2.4 or later for full support
- [Witchery](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/witchery)
